    <h2>1945</h2>
    <p>
      Vannevar Bush writes an article in Atlantic Monthly about a
      photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for memory extension,
      which could make and follow links between documents on microfiche

    <h2>1960s</h2>
    <p>
      Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext
      browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose.

    <h2>1980</h2>
    <p>
      While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a
      notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to
      be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list
      of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under
      SINTRAN-III. See: <a href="0">Enquire user manual as scanned images</a> or
